As proof that the ideas of <emphasis effect="italics">A Unified Theory of a Law</emphasis> systematically arrange themselves into a coherent legal ideology, a table has been created showing the connections amongst the three permutations of a law, who decides whether or not to engage upon a course of conduct, the two polarities of conduct, the metaphors that help us understand the opinions of a Lawmaker, the opinions of a Lawmaker themselves, and the vehicles that convey the opinions.

An analogy helpful to understand what a Lawmaker does in the process of making a Law is currency.  The currency that a Lawmaker gets to "spend" during the process of making a law consists of three (3) coins. The names of the three (3) coins are:

<list id="eip-id1172135486214">
<item>Affirmative Regulation</item>
<item>Deregulation and</item>
<item>Negative Regulation</item>
</list>
        
Each coin has three sides: two outsides and a middle. The coins have three sides because a Lawmaker has three focuses (foci). One side is for a Lawmaker who focuses on the Source doing conduct. Another side is for a Lawmaker who focuses on the Recipient receiving conduct. The middle is reserved for a Lawmaker whose focus is amorphous on neither or both the Source nor the Recipient. Each side holds 1) a Lawmaker's opinion, 2) the vehicle used by the Lawmaker to convey the opinion and 3) the metaphor that helps explain the opinion.

A Lawmaker engages in lawmaking by "applying" one of the three coins to conduct flowing from a Source to a Recipient through circumstances. The three (3) coins are the only things that a Lawmaker can "spend" in making a law.

Hence, it is helpful to keep these four objects in mind. Three coins and one instance of conduct flowing from Source to Recipient through circumstances. The process of Lawmaking involves these four objects.

The doctrine of Occamâ€™s Razor holds that the simplest solution is often the best solution. Therefore, if three (3) coins are sufficient to give our minds a high fidelity model of the lawmaking process then there is no need for any more. In short, any additional "coins" would be counterfeit.
